# Dice_Game

2 players will each have an array of positive integers.
The value k of each index within each array represents a die numbered evenly from 1 to k.

Both players will roll all their dice respectively, and record their highest values from their set of dice.
Whoever has the larger highest value, wins. If the highest values of each players are the same, the scores are tied.

This app will take 2 arrays as inputs, and output the probability of each player winning, as well as a tie.
