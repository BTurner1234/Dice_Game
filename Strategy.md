1. Order the array player_1 (holds the values of all the dice) negatively from largest to smallest.
2. Create a new array "vals" of length max(player_1) where vals[i] represents the number of dice at or above i+1.
3. Create new array "probs" also of length max(player_1) where probs[i] represents the probability of i+1 being the largest value among a roll of the set of dice.
4. Create a cumulative summation of probs called "probs_cumsum"
5. Repeat for player_2
6. Substitute these values into the formulae.
7. ???
8. Calculate values for output.
